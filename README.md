### Running the Application

Un-zip the file and copy the `dist` folder onto a local server. When accessing http://localhost:[port], you should
be able to see the home page.


### Re-building the Application.

Prerequisites:

- Get [Node.js][node-download].
- From under the root of the un-zipped folder, install the tool dependencies: `npm install`
- Install gulp-cli.

Optional, you can run `gulp jshint` for validation.

Run `gulp`, which will re-build the `dist` directory.
